    GNS3 Talks: Python for Network Engineers with GNS3 (Part 1). Network programmability made easy.
  ",,David Bombal,,"173,741 views","2,775",28,"Published on Apr 5, 2017","Udemy: Get the course for $10 here: , https://goo.gl/QYC988, GNS3 Academy: Get the course for $10 here: , https://goo.gl/vnZJhg, More free Python videos here: , https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list..., Learn Python programming with GNS3. In this series of videos I will show you how you can quickly and easily program Cisco networks using Python. In this video we program a Cisco IOSv router using Python on an Ubuntu Docker container., The script used in this video is available on GitHub here:, https://github.com/davidbombal/python..., Transcription:, This is one of multiple videos discussing Python programming. Now there's a lot of information on the internet with regards to Python programming, but in these series of videos I'm going to concentrate solely on the use of Python with networking devices and specifically with gns3 ., I'm a very strong believer in practical learning. Think about it, when you were a child, did you go to university or school to learn how to ride a bike? Typically you learnt how to ride a bike by riding a bike and falling off a few times, making mistakes. But as you practiced you got better and better at riding a bike., I think the same is true for any other skill that you want to gain and any other knowledge that you want to obtain. The best way to do it is to just do it , make mistakes, pick yourself up and try again. And with that in mind I'm going to show you how quickly you can get programming a Cisco network using Python., In Google I've done a search for Python telnet and my first hitch is the telnet library or telnet client available in Python 2.7. Now there's a large debate in Python community about which version of Python you should learn. Python 2.7 is being replaced by Python 3. But notice on the Python website you can still download Python 2.7 and a lot of operating systems and network devices have version 2.7 by default. I'm going to show you both Python 2.7 and python 3 as part of these videos or as part of my GNS3 Python course. You may only have Python 2.7 available so it's good to know that but you should also learn Python 3 for the future., So notice the simple script that we can copy from the Python documentation. We'll start off with a script and start programming our GNS3 topology., In GNS3, I'm going to drag a iOS router to the workspace as well as an iOSv switch. These devices take a while to boot up, so to allow my docker containers to connect to the Internet quickly, I'm going to use a layer 2 switch.  One of the docker containers available is in a blue 2 container and that's what I'm going to use in this topology rather than trying to get python running on your Windows PC or trying to get Python working on other operating systems. It's going to be a lot quicker for us just to use a docker container and add that to our GNS3 topology., Again, my belief is start or learning as quickly as you can, make mistakes and learn from that. Don't get hung up with trying to learn the best way to do everything right away. Just get started., Some people believe that they need to have a degree to become a programmer or use programming skills in networking. I don't necessarily agree with that. Just get started., So on the Ubuntu machine I'm going to edit to the config. I'm going to set this device to use DHCP and click Save and click start. To boot up the network, I'm going to open up a console, to each device., Now again the Cisco devices will take a while to boot up but our docker container has already booted up and we can already ping google.com even though the switch and the router are still , booting., So how to get update? We will get update our references in ubuntu, that's done, will install Python. , In this first example I'm going to install Python 2.7. So Python version of Python that we're using is 2.7. 1. So here is the script that we're going to start off with it's not perfect. What we will be doing now is not necessarily the most optimized way of implementing a script like this but the , idea there is, we want to get started, get it working by for instance creating a loop back on the router and configuring VLANs on the switch and then we can build on our script and optimize it., I'm going to use nano to create a file so let's call this python Router1 script 1 to start off with. And then I'm going to paste the code off the internet into nano. so we‚Äôre importing modules here get passes telnet library., The device that we're going to telnet to is going to be the router. So we need to configure the router's IP address, username and password and other details for when the script telnets , to the router. So before we continue with our script let's configure the network devices. See here's the router it's booted up. Now I'll bypass the initial configuration dialog., Transcription limited by YouTube.","

    Brian Barczyk & Why Spider Ball Pythons are Terrible
  ",,GoHerping,Verified,"698,301 views","35,950","3,983","Published on Feb 25, 2019","Spider ball pythons have been banned from some European expos. Was this a mistake? Should more expos make the same moves? What's wrong with spider ball pythons anyway? Today, we talk about the wobble, corkscrew, feeding issues and more in this the spider gene, while breaking down Brian Barczyk's vlog, ""defending"" spider ball pythons. Honestly he kind of made it too easy., Edit: In reference to the super cinnamon clip,  'The Python Burrow' clarified that: ""He didn't breed Cinnamon to Cinnamon Mr. Know it all he was showing a parthenogenesis clutch that he had ZERO control over."" Sorry for the misunderstanding there., Brian's video is here to ensure nothing was taken out of context: , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=118nJ..., Have you see a spider ball python with a spider wobble? What about more severe issues? Should the International Herp Society not have banned the gene from expos?

It is available for the Python 2.x and 3.x, Qt library is one of the most powerful GUI libraries. The official home site for PyQt5 is¬†www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/news. PyQt5 is developed by Riverbank Computing , PyQt5 is implemented as a set of Python modules. It has over 620 classes and 6000 functions and methods. It is a multiplatform toolkit which runs on all major operating systems, including Unix, Windows, and Mac OS. PyQt5 is dual licensed. Developers can choose between a GPL and a commercial license, 2 Tkinter, Tkinter¬†is a Python binding to the Tk GUI toolkit. Tk is the original GUI library for the Tcl language. Tkinter is implemented as a Python wrapper around a complete Tcl interpreter embedded in the Python interpreter it is a built in module in python, when you have installed python tkinter will be , Installed by defualt, 3 Wxpython, wxPython¬†is a Python wrapper for¬†wxWidgets¬†(which is written in C++), a popular cross-platform GUI toolkit. Developed by Robin Dunn along with Harri Pasanen, wxPython is implemented as a Python extension module., Just like wxWidgets, wxPython is also a free software. It can be downloaded from the official website¬†, http://wxpython.org.¬†Binaries,  and source code for many operating system platforms are available for download on this site., Principal modules in wxPython API include a core module. It consists of¬†wxObject¬†class, which is the base for all classes in the API. Control module contains all the widgets used in GUI application development. For example, wx.Button, wx.StaticText (analogous to a label), wx.TextCtrl (editable text control), etc., wxPython API has GDI (Graphics Device Interface) module. It is a set of classes used for drawing on widgets. Classes like font, color, brush, etc. are a part of it. All the container window classes are defined in Windows module, 4 Kivy, Kivy is an open source Python framework for creating cross-platform multi-touch mobile applications with Natural User Interface. Its speed is comparable to other native mobile alternatives like Java for Android and Objective C for iOS. Kivy is the only solution for coding in Python on mobile devices. It is also capable of running on multiple platforms like HTML5 because it does not depend on heavy browser support, and is implemented in C using Cython due to which it runs directly on the GPU. The main aim that was kept in mind while developing Kivy was to run the same code on multiple platforms., 5 PyForms, At¬†just two years old (making it one of the more recent frameworks),¬†Pyforms¬†is a Python 2.7/3.x cross-environment framework for developing GUI applications. It is modular and encourages code reusability with minimal effort., Based on PyQt, OpenGL and other libraries, it provides a quite comprehensive set of 22 controls, all based on a ControlBase object; it also includes a video player, web browser and OpenGL.","

    Alligator Attacks Python 01 Narration
  ",,ojatro,Verified,"4,671,187 views","15,062","2,568","Published on Apr 21, 2017","Website 01:     , http://www.ojatrovisuals.com/, Website 02:     , http://ojatro.com, Facebook:     , https://www.facebook.com/Ojatro, Google:     , https://plus.google.com/+ojatro/posts, Alligators are ambush predators and drowning is their preferred method of killing prey., Like all crocodilians, they can wait hours before ambushing their prey. If the alligator doesn‚Äôt succeed braking its prey‚Äôs neck, which is easily done with raccoons, opossums and birds in general. But large pythons are difficult to kill even for a fully grown alligator. Therefore the python needs to be drowned., But the Everglades‚Äô water level is extremely low during dry season. The alligator needs to find deeper waters in order to kill the snake. After dragging the burmese python through the swamp for hours, the snake becomes so agitated that it bites at anything in reach. The python‚Äôs carcass was found a few days later. The alligator might have stashed it in an underwater burrow but the decomposing gasses pushed it to the surface. The alligator kept closely watching over its prey. But the floating carcass might attracted other predators, including larger alligators. , It is not fully understood if the chewing on the dead python is a conscious act or just a instinct. Yet it‚Äôs clear that the alligator tries to get the floating carcass under water. The python‚Äôs skin is though to say the least and even the alligator‚Äôs constant bitting doesn‚Äôt seem do much damage to it. With the low water level, the carcass remains visible and an open invitation for other predators to join the feast. This clearly seems to agitates the alligator and repeatedly it tries submerging the bloated python. But to no avail. The alligator will try to find a secure location, hiding for a few more days until progressed decomposition will have the python‚Äôs body broken down and ready to devour., American Alligators are opportunistic feeders and have been know to prey on the invasive Burmese Python in South Florida. Regardless, killing an adult python is not an easy task even for Florida‚Äôs top predators. Alligators in general ambush their prey than dragging it into the deep water and drowning it. These killing technic doesn‚Äôt work alway, in particular if the water level is too low. The burmese python is able to avoid being drowned by keeping its head above the water. Every so often the alligator will try to brake the python‚Äôs neck by vigorously shaking it. Alligator Attacks Burmese Python was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in Florida in 2014.","

    Indigo Snake Eats Python 01 - Snake Cannibalism
  ",S1 ‚Ä¢ E41,ojatro,Verified,"9,631,461 views","18,586","2,813","Published on Nov 27, 2014","Website:     , http://Ojatro.com, Facebook:  , https://www.facebook.com/Ojatro, Google:     , https://plus.google.com/+ojatro/posts, Newborn Burmese Python have to move quickly away from their nest before predators picks up their sent. The Indigo Snake is a formidable snake hunter, which would not hesitate to attack and feed on rattlesnakes, cottonmouth and over vipers because it is immune to against their venom. The sent of a python hatchling just passing through its territory get his undivided attention and the hunter begins stalking its prey., With a swift bite to the python‚Äôs head, the indigo snake subdues the hatchling, firmly holding it in its grip and blocking the prey‚Äôs airway with its powerful jaws. But good nutrition has giving the feisty young python enough strength to fight back its attacker.  Still the larger indigo has no problem overpowering the smaller snake. It‚Äôs only a question of time until the python‚Äôs energy recourses have been exhausted. Through constituently pinning the young python to the ground, the attacker‚Äôs strategy is simply to tire its prey enough before swallowing it alive., The hatchlings is loosing its strength fast and being dragged near the Indigo‚Äôs lair to avoid the risk of being discovered by other predators. The hungry snakes eats its prey fast and alive. The python hatchling is doomed and any resistance is in vain by now., Humans represent the biggest threat to indigo snakes. Highway fatalities, wanton killings, and overcollection for the pet trade adversely affect indigo snake populations. Snakes are taken illegally from the wild for the pet trade. Eastern indigo snakes are sometimes ""gassed"" in their burrows by rattlesnake hunters. Indigo Snake Eats Python was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in 2009.","

  ",,ojatro,Verified,"1,633,285 views","5,351",852,"Published on Apr 17, 2017","Website 01:     , http://www.ojatrovisuals.com/, Website 02:     , http://ojatro.com, Facebook:     , https://www.facebook.com/Ojatro, Google:     , https://plus.google.com/+ojatro/posts, This skinny, yet feisty three feet alligator attacked a large (ca. twelve feet) burmese python, while basking near the water‚Äôs edge. The python is not just too large for the small alligator but its also very dangerous to attack and fight such large prey. It‚Äôs obvious that the python was not at all interested in feeding on the alligator. Due to its reluctance to asphyxiate the alligator it might be suggested that the large constrictor must have devoured something earlier that day., In general, american alligators are opportunistic feeders and have been know to prey on the invasive Burmese Python in South Florida. Regardless, killing an adult python is not an easy task even for Florida‚Äôs top predators. Alligators in general ambush their prey than dragging it into the deep water and drowning it. These killing technic doesn‚Äôt work alway, in particular if the water level is too low. The burmese python is able to avoid being drowned by keeping its head above the water. Every so often the alligator will try to brake the python‚Äôs neck by vigorously shaking it. , Braking the prey‚Äôs neck might be an effective method to kill mammals and birds but it certainly won‚Äôt do much harm to the python in this case. Alligators have no problem crashing the hard shell of turtles but bitting through the tough python skin is a different matter. Nevertheless, the alligator‚Äôs bite force of 2000 pound per square inch will cause internal injuries on which the constrictor might die eventually. Alligator Attacks Burmese Python was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in Florida in 2016.","

    The Burmese Python Problem In The Florida Everglades

The Wizard of Odd TV went to the florida everglades to meet Trapper Mike Kimmel aka The Python Cowboy. Python hunter Trapper Mike Kimmel is a well known trapper and has been on the news for many of his captures.  The Burmese Python is an invasive species that has  eaten their way though much of the native wildlife, including raccoons, foxes, marsh rabbits, birds and even alligator. 99 percent of the fur-bearing animals are gone thanks to the Burmese Python.  The Python Cowboy has dedicated his life to Python hunting in hopes that one day the native wild life will return once again.  You will see him catching a giant snake in this video and there is way more out there!

    Monty Python: The Parrot Sketch & The Lumberjack Song movie versions HQ
  ",,morpheusatloppers,,"804,374 views","6,066",190,"Published on Nov 15, 2009","Anecdotally, I once found myself IN this pet shop. It was in the Caledonian Road, North London. I wandered in - I was passing and needed something or other - and realised it looked familiar. Then I saw the signed picture behind the counter. It was a still of John and Michael in that ""very boutique""., The shop-owner explained that when they'd done the bit on TV, they'd HAD to do it in the studio - for the audience reaction. But since this was for the FILM (""And Now For Something Completely Different"") there would be no live audience. And with the superior definition of a film, a set just wouldn't MAKE it. Real pet shops have CLUTTER. And so they'd gone and found one - HIS., I don't know if the shop is still there - if it is, the guy has probably made more money letting people be photographed there (like on the crossing outside the Abbey Road studios) than he has selling Norwegian Blue parrots!, p.s. xmichelledd asked me if I'd post the following URL - for good karma! I've checked it out and it is what she said it was - a huge DVD set of ALL the Monty Python sketches, on Amazon - so fair enough., The URL is: , http://urlsnippy.com/CompleteMontyPyt..., But please note: Amazon are only able to ship to certain countries - however, if you live in one they DON'T ship to, you should still be able to find a NEW example of this set on EBAY - whose merchants can usually ship ANYWHERE. Just AVOID their ""third-party"" shipper - ""Channel Advisor"" - and use the merchant's OWN shipping service. Good luck.","

    Python eats Alligator 03 - Time Lapse - Reverse
  ",,ojatro,Verified,"12,854,955 views","12,252","4,095","Published on May 31, 2012","Website:     , http://Ojatro.com, Facebook:  , https://www.facebook.com/Ojatro, Google:     , https://plus.google.com/+ojatro/posts, Burmese pythons have an established permanent breeding population in South Florida and belong to the ‚Äúnew‚Äù apex predators of the Everglades today. Top predators like the american alligators prey regularly on all kinds of reptiles, including pythons. An adult alligator will have little trouble to overpower, kill and eat any juvenile and in some cases even an adult constrictor. , A fully grown Burmese Python can reach over twenty feet in lengths and becomes extremely dangerous prey item for most crocodilians. These large constrictors have not much to fear and will feed on most animals they come across (including alligators) when hungry. Pythons are non venomous snakes and kill by constricting their prey, wrapping its body around in a thigh coil until the animals dies of suffocation within a few minuets. The prey will be swallowed mostly head first and whole. This process can take considerable time  during which the snake is vulnerable to attacks from other predators. Confrontations between pythons and alligator have been recorded during the last years but still, very little is know on the outcome of such ‚Äúfights‚Äù. The fact is that invasive species like the burmese pythons are a part of the Everglades today and it is up to everyone to find out as much as possible and use the newly gain knowledge to keep the python population in check. Alligator attacks python filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro near the Everglades in 2013.","

Alligators are opportunistic feeders and have been know to prey on snakes, including venomous snakes such as cottonmouth and rattlesnakes. But they also prey on larger snakes, such as the invasive Burmese Python in Florida. Killing such powerful snakes can turn out fatal even for a fully grown alligator., Alligators prefer to drown their prey and would keep it submerged for a few minutes before swallowing it whole. This killing technique might work well with birds and most mammals but it doesn‚Äôt work as well for snakes, which can stay underwater for about thirty minutes. Alligator Eats Python was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in South Florida in 2014.","

But this is not the legendary monarch and valiant team you might remember from stories of yore; though this tale stars Sir Lancelot, Sir Bedevere and the Lady Of The Lake, it also features insulting Frenchmen, inventive use of coconuts, a homicidal rabbit and the infamous Knights who say Ni.","

    Using Python to Code by Voice
  ",,Next Day Video,,"300,513 views","2,614",39,"Published on Mar 20, 2013","Tavis RuddTwo years ago I developed a case of Emacs Pinkie (RSI) so severe my hands went numb and I could no longer type or work. Desperate, I tried voice recognition. At first programming with it was painfully slow but, as I couldn't type, I persevered. After several months of vocab tweaking and duct-tape coding in Python and Emacs Lisp, I had a system that enabled me to code faster and more efficiently by voice than I ever had by hand., In a fast-paced live demo, I will create a small system using Python, plus a few other languages for good measure, and deploy it without touching the keyboard. The demo gods will make a scheduled appearance. I hope to convince you that voice recognition is no longer a crutch for the disabled or limited to plain prose. It's now a highly effective tool that could benefit all programmers.","

    Python Eats Goat 01 Stock Footage
  ",,ojatro,Verified,"16,910,994 views","28,275","6,729","Published on Jul 16, 2015","http://Ojatro.com, http://Ojatroblog.blogspot.com, Pythons are large constrictors and became very popular reptiles in the US pet trade during the late eighties but the mass importation has led to serious ecological problem in South Florida. The small python hatchlings out grow fast their initial setup cage and reaching eight foot in length within three years. Many pet owners no longer wish to care for their snake(s) and some people even decided to release their pythons back into the wild. During Hurricane Andrew, a mass escape of reptiles, including thousands of burmese pythons, from their exotic importers took place in 1992., Many pythons escaped into the swamps of the Everglades with its perfect subtropical climate and vast food sources. These snakes began to thrive, resulting in a permanent breeding population of Burmese Pythons in South Florida. But also the African Rock Python has established a breeding population in Florida and many other species of pythons, such as the Reticulated Python can be found occasionally. Pythons spend the majority of their time hidden in the underbrush. They are nocturnal, ambush predators, feeding meanly on mammals, birds and other reptiles, including alligators and crocodiles. It has been observed that these constrictors turn into opportunistic feeders as well and do not hesitate to devour road kill or other dead animals they come across. In fact, some pythons have learned that road are not just a place to warm their body during the night but a perfect location for catching an easy meal. , A hungry adult python stalks its prey with fast forward movements, its head slightly elevated and  tongue flickering, picking up the sent particles of possible prey near by. When a possible prey animal is detected the attack is swift with a strike and a bite to the neck, coiling around the prey‚Äôs body, tighter and tighter until it eventually dies of asphyxiation. The python starts mostly feeding on the dead animal head first mostly but it has been observed that very often pythons will swallow their prey alive. The feeding can take up to an hour depending on the size of the prey. Python eats goat was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro in South Florida in 2015.","

    Python vs Alligator 16 - Real Fight - Python attacks Alligator
  ",,ojatro,Verified,"10,231,627 views","9,174","1,912","Published on Nov 4, 2011","Website:     , http://Ojatro.com, Facebook:  , https://www.facebook.com/Ojatro, Google:     , https://plus.google.com/+ojatro/posts, Burmese pythons have established a permanent breeding population in South Florida and belong to the ""new"" apex predators of the Everglades today. Top predators like the american crocodiles and american alligators prey regularly on all kinds of reptiles, including pythons. An adult alligator will have little trouble to overpower, kill and eat any juvenile and in some cases even an adult constrictor. Nevertheless, a fully grown Burmese Python can reach over twenty feet in lengths and becomes extremely dangerous prey item for most crocodilians including the American Alligator. These large constrictors have not much to fear and will feed on most animals they come across (including alligators) when hungry. Python vs Alligator was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro near the Everglades in 2009.","

    How to Call Python from MATLAB
  ",,MATLAB,Verified,"4,829 views",155,0,"Published on Oct 7, 2019","This video shows how to call Python code from MATLAB¬Æ using a sentiment analysis example. This example consists of listening to audio through a microphone, detecting text from speech, and using a pretrained machine learning model to predict the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) of the detected text. , In the example, MATLAB is first used to record audio data from a microphone. A user-defined Python module is then used to detect text from the audio signal. This text is then returned to MATLAB to continue performing the sentiment analysis., Resources:, ‚Ä¢ System and configuration requirements to call Python from MATLAB: , http://bit.ly/2nZ9mlJ,  , ‚Ä¢ Call user-defined Python modules in MATLAB: , http://bit.ly/2nVyoCb, ‚Ä¢ Train a sentiment classifier: , http://bit.ly/2pqUQn3, ‚Ä¢ Sequence classification using deep learning: , http://bit.ly/2pt3RMx, --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------, Get a free product trial: , https://goo.gl/ZHFb5u, Learn more about MATLAB: , https://goo.gl/8QV7ZZ, Learn more about Simulink: , https://goo.gl/nqnbLe, See What's new in MATLAB and Simulink: , https://goo.gl/pgGtod, ¬© 2019 The MathWorks, Inc.

Reticulated pythons are the longest snake in the world growing well over 20 feet / 6 meters., for licensing stock snake footage contact hankschyma@yahoo.com, More info..., Reticulated Pythons or ""Retics"" are native to Southeast Asia and can grow well over 20 feet / 6 meters earning it the title, the longest snake in the world. ¬†Though extremely unlikely, large reticulated pythons can kill a person and several plausible reports of human consumption exist. ¬†, PYTHON BITE, Retics have a reputation for being grouchy and quick to bite.  I think they‚Äôre precious and just need a little more sweet talking. Still, I wouldn't recommend one for a pet. They get out of control big!  I used to breed smaller Indian pythons and when a friend could no longer provide the amount of space to adequately house their 8 foot retic, I agreed to take over the burden. Eventually the snake grew to 16 feet long, and she never once tried to bite me‚Ä¶ Unless it was feeding time. , Pythons have about a hundred long sharp teeth designed for grabbing. There are four rows on the top and two rows on the bottom. If you get bitten by a large specimen, there will be blood. Usually after a defensive bite the snake lets go but sometimes if the victim jerks and panics the snake cannot get its teeth out of your flesh and the wounds tear and may cause a lot of swelling.  I watched this happen to my sister once when my 6 foot burmese python bit her hand.  Generally whenever I get bitten by a python, I don't flinch and the snake easily lets go.   Sometimes in captivity, pythons get what I call ""food crazy."" The instant you walk into the room with food, the snake gets possessed and strikes at anything that moves. This is usually the result of neglect. The snake gets conditioned to associate the cage opening for feeding only.  , All it takes is non-aggressive body language and patience and you can sweet talk just about any snake out of defensive biting.  Once a python feels reassured you're not a threat, you‚Äôll see their gentle, curious side., PYTHONS CHANGING COLOR, Many people don't know that many snakes can change color and relics are one of the best at it.  It's not as dramatic as a chameleons color change, but in hours a retics olive and grey can turn to vibrant gold and light blueish-grey.  In direct sunlight a rainbow of iridescence appears on healthy Reticulated pythons. Emerald greens, fluorescent purples and blues sparkle on golden scales.","

    Kings of Pain: Outrageous Python Bite Leaves Adam Bloody | Series Premieres Nov. 12 10/9c | HISTORY
  ",S3 ‚Ä¢ E14,HISTORY,Verified,"896,215 views",505,203,"Published on Sep 27, 2019","HISTORY‚Äôs new unscripted series ‚ÄúKings of Pain‚Äù follows wildlife biologist Adam Thorn and professional animal handler Rob ‚ÄúCaveman‚Äù Alleva as they get bit and stung by some of the most dangerous animals and vicious stinging insects in the world ‚Äì from a reticulated python to a rove beetle ‚Äì to create a complete and comprehensive pain index that will ultimately help save lives. The eight-episode, one-hour series premieres Tuesday, November 12 at 10PM ET/PT on HISTORY., In 1983 entomologist Dr. Justin O. Schmidt began ranking stinging insects on a scale from 1-4, putting himself in harm‚Äôs way for science creating the Schmidt sting pain index and authoring the book The Sting of The Wild. Now Thorn and Alleva are taking Schmidt‚Äôs pain index even further adding venomous bites and more deadly creatures and ranking them on a 30-point scale with new categories including intensity, duration and damage. Their goal is to create history‚Äôs ultimate and fully comprehensive guide to measuring pain. In addition, they will be consulting with Schmidt as they build this new pain index that is completely new to science to be used as an educational tool showcasing which creatures humans should avoid and what to do in the event they do get bitten or stung., Each episode will chronicle Thorn and Alleva as they track the animal in its natural habitat, safely trap it and then execute the bite or sting on each other, followed by their ranking of the pain results. An onsite medic is present who monitors the health and well-being of both men and describes to viewers exactly what physical and physiological effects each bite and/or sting is creating within their bodies. Along their journey, viewers will also be learning about the history of each animal featured and its often-uncomfortable relationship with humans. Deadly wildlife featured over this eight-episode season include the Nile monitor lizard, executioner wasp, fire urchin, rove beetle, lionfish, scorpion fish, bullet ant, piranha, tarantula hawk, giant Asian centipede and the reticulated python ‚Äì to name a few. Audiences will also get the chance to travel the world from the remote jungles of Bolivia, the Amazon and Indonesia to the beaches of Bali, South Africa, Mexico and Baja California., Subscribe for more HISTORY:, http://www.youtube.com/subscription_c..., Check out exclusive HISTORY content:, History Newsletter: , http://po.st/HistoryNewsletter, Website - , http://po.st/HistoryWeb, Facebook - , http://po.st/HistoryFacebook, Twitter - , http://po.st/HistoryTwitter, HISTORY¬Æ is the leading destination for award-winning original series and specials that connect viewers with history in an informative, immersive, and entertaining manner across all platforms.

    Introduction - Django Web Development with Python 1
  ",,sentdex,Verified,"987,784 views","8,020",168,"Published on Jan 19, 2016","Welcome to a Django web development with Python tutorial series. Django is a Python web development framework, aimed at rapid development and deployment., One of the more common questions people have is ""which framework"" they should use. There are quite a few for Python, with Django and Flask being the two most popular., Flask is more of what we call a ""micro"" web framework. It is much ""lower level"" than Django is. This allows for more customization and control for the developer., Django is much more of a higher-level framework, and imposes a set structure on the developer., Thus, with Flask you can create systems your way, which is probably not most efficient, fastest, or secure way. With Django, you are a bit more constrained, but you are going to most likely do it the best way possible. As with almost all questions people ask me regarding which to use, the answer is: Try a few, and choose the one you like best. In the end, Django and Flask can be used to make the exact same websites!, To try Django, you need to get Django first (you will also need Python installed). This is exceptionally simple:, pip install Django, Text-based tutorial and sample code: , https://pythonprogramming.net/django-..., https://pythonprogramming.net, https://twitter.com/sentdex, https://www.facebook.com/pythonprogra..., https://plus.google.com/+sentdex","

You can then move onto advanced programming concepts and skills. That is exactly how this python tutorial is structured. First, you will learn how to do simple tasks by understanding the concept behind the code. At first, the code seems difficult but after some practice, it will seem so much easier. That is because you understand what you are doing., To give you the best chance of learning to be a great coder, we explain each concept so you can see it as child splay ‚Äì this is too easy. Terms like conditionals, iterations, parameters etc. make it all seem confusing, but do not fear, even we get confused when we see these books and course where nobody can understand what the author is saying. That is not you that is them! , Not only can you now understand how to do simple coding tasks but you will be confident enough to be able to help others.  We will show you the simple methods of putting lines or blocks of code together using this knowledge. Practice is essential for your skills to grow but again do not fear we will help you practice as well. When you go online for help you need to understand others, therefore we will show you then meaning of the common terms. We will give you useful hints, such as how to tell the difference between python 2 or python 3 code., Videos will be the whole package. Learn to understand the logic and design aspects needed to become a good programmer, let us help you practice to keep improving and don‚Äôt forget the bonus of seeing first hand how to build the code and possible stumbling blocks when we explain the answers to the tasks set within the tutorial. You do not need to watch the whole video but if you do you will improve as a python coder!, SUBSCRIBE and you will know when the videos are available! Good luck!","

    Python Packaging 2.0: Playing Well With Others

    Why Python is the Future
  ",,Techy Help,,"68,879 views",None,None,"Published on Jul 4, 2014","Can you tell me why Python is the future?, I think you've been listening to too many Python fans. Ian Bicking wrote a blog about why you ought to leave Python., I'm sure you could find someone proclaiming why Lisp will be the future despite not taking off after forty years. And there are millions of Python users who are voting with their installations., One of the reasons Python is so popular is because of GitHub. That makes it much easier to add patches to a project., So much for a community getting together and recoding something instead., Another advantage of Python is its large, supportive community. You get a massive code library from it, open source support, free learning resources and online discussion boards., That's where inertia takes over. What was popular before remains popular because it has the larger customer base., And having a large user base does mean that Python has more tools for everything from debugging, to testing to custom plug-in design relative to niche languages, where programmers have to invent that neat little feature they want., Windows has a lot of tools, and inertia, too. That does not mean it has a future., Python is one of the most commonly taught programming languages, as well as an easier to learn one. You may find as many jobs in Java, but working with it well is harder., Whereas Ruby will only get you a job in Silicon Valley., Ruby on Rails is good for programmer productivity at slapping together apps. Python lets you build everything from software interfaces to websites to games., What about languages like PHP and C#?, I'd say C# is a niche for those who want to use Microsoft servers but avoid ASP.net like the plague. PHP is a niche, far smaller than Python, which hinders its future., Lua and CoffeeScript I know are flashes in the pan. What keeps Python from following that path?, When you install Linux, there are two major dynamic interpreters -- Python and Perl. And Python has more uses., So the open source community has made it a default language for itself., And that's why it has a bright future.","

    Should I Learn Python or Objective C?
  ",,Techy Help,,"3,378 views",None,None,"Published on Mar 13, 2014","Should I learn Python or Objective C?, C++ is often done for Windows programming projects, while Objective C is more for Mac. If you want to do iPhone development, you have to learn Objective C., What good is Python?, Python runs on any platform that supports C, so it isn't limited to the Mac., Which language gives you more options?, When it comes to programming, Ruby, Perl and Python are nearly cross-platform and can be used anywhere. Objective C is primarily limited to the OS X, the iPhone and some OpenStep environments., So learning Objective C means I'm joining the cult of Apple., There are Objective-C bridges for Python and C, so you could write Python for Apple devices if you really wanted to. Or a really niche OpenStep app developer., And Python at least lets me work on Unix as well., Python is also more versatile., I've heard Python is a good language for developers., You can use it or its spawn PyGames to create games, and Python is used for graphics and desktop applications as well. In short, you can develop almost anything with it., I've heard of it being used for web projects., True, but you could use JavaScript, too., Which one has a better library?, Python, definitely. And Python is easier to prototype in., Then it sounds like I need to learn Python., Or you could learn both software languages and PyObjC, the bridge between the two., One is hard enough as it is. If I have to bridge a gap, I'll invest the time and learn both., At least Python has a massive library to make the process of learning it easier, and tons of learning resources., You get that with any long standing programming language., Then you can get with the Python program and get going.","

    Python Standard Library: The Hidden Gems
  ",,Coding Tech,Verified,"14,469 views",396,5,"Published on Oct 8, 2019","The Python Standard Library is a very rich toolset, which is the reason why Python is stated to come with """"batteries included"""". In such an amount of features and tools it's easy to get lost and miss some of the less unknown modules or gems hidden within the whole load of functions and classes., This talk aims at showcasing some recipes, snippets and usages of standard library modules and functions that are less known or that are not covered in the most common books and tutorials available for Python., The talk will try to showcase a bunch of short examples in the hope to foster the """"oh, wow! I didn't think about that"""" reaction at least once in the audience., We will see how frequently for tasks where you used third party libraries or frameworks a solution bultin into the standard library is already available, and such solution is guaranteed to be maintained and well working for the years to come thanks to the standard library reliability and stability., The showcased examples are took from the ‚ÄúModern Python Standard Library Cookbook‚Äù book that I authored., EVENT:, EuroPython 2019 - Talk - 2019-07-12 - Boston, SPEAKER:, Alessandro Molina, PUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:, Original video was published with the Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)., ATTRIBUTION CREDITS:, Original video source: , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhn0p...","

    Python Program for deleting and rewritting files
  ",,Peter Steele,,"2,625 views",4,4,"Published on Aug 29, 2010",This is a program that I wrote in python.  It allows you to open a file with the program and then delete its contents and rewrite anything you want to it. It is great if you dont feel like opening the file in a text editor to just maybe jot down a note or something while you are working in the terminal. I use it often when writing programs in an idle. I just have one file that I can call up and erase and write down any notes at the moment without having to open up a text editor. You can adapt it for so many other uses as well but this is just a simple version to show you the mechanics of how it all works.,"

IDLE provides an interpreter window, into which expressions and commands can be typed for immediate evaluation (and where the output of programs is printed), and a separate Editor window can be opened for each python file that you are working with. Programs are run by selecting a menu option or pressing function key F5, in contrast to the PyScripter interface, that provides a ""play"" button. Your python files are colour-coded by syntax.","

    Python eats Alligator 02, Time Lapse Speed x6
  ",,ojatro,Verified,"120,050,395 views","132,929","31,932","Published on Dec 14, 2011","Website:     , http://Ojatro.com, Facebook:  , https://www.facebook.com/Ojatro, Google:     , https://plus.google.com/+ojatro/posts, Burmese pythons have an established permanent breeding population in South Florida and belong to the ‚Äúnew‚Äù apex predators of the Everglades today. Top predators like the american alligators prey regularly on all kinds of reptiles, including pythons. An adult alligator will have little trouble to overpower, kill and eat any juvenile and in some cases even an adult constrictor. , A fully grown Burmese Python can reach over twenty feet in lengths and becomes extremely dangerous prey item for most crocodilians. These large constrictors have not much to fear and will feed on most animals they come across (including alligators) when hungry. Pythons are non venomous snakes and kill by constricting their prey, wrapping its body around in a thigh coil until the animals dies of suffocation within a few minuets. The prey will be swallowed mostly head first and whole. This process can take considerable time  during which the snake is vulnerable to attacks from other predators. Confrontations between pythons and alligator have been recorded during the last years but still, very little is know on the outcome of such ‚Äúfights‚Äù. The fact is that invasive species like the burmese pythons are a part of the Everglades today and it is up to everyone to find out as much as possible and use the newly gain knowledge to keep the python population in check. Alligator attacks python filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro near the Everglades in 2013.","

  ",,CodingEntrepreneurs,,"487,520 views","3,902",115,"Published on Feb 12, 2014","Coding With Python :: Learn API Basics to Grab Data with Python, This is a basic introduction to using APIs. APIs are the ""glue"" that keep a lot of web applications running and thriving. Without APIs much of the internet services you love might not even exist!, APIs are easy way to connect with other websites & web services to use their data to make your site or application even better. This simple tutorial gives you the basics of how you can access this data and use it. If you want to know if a website has an api, just search ""Facebook API"" or ""Twitter API"" or ""Foursquare API"" on google. Some APIs are easy to use (like Locu's API which we use in this video) some are more complicated (Facebook's API is more complicated than Locu's). More about APIs: , http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Api, Code from the video: , http://pastebin.com/tFeFvbXp, If you want to learn more about using APIs with Django, learn at , http://CodingForEntrepreneurs.com,  for just $25/month.

A pet sold in stores throughout the US, when it gets too big or too old for its owner it typically gets released into the wild. When this happens in Florida, where the Everglades tall grasses are identical to Southeast Asia, the animal thrives, breeding in huge numbers and eating whatever it wants thanks to a complete absence of natural predators. On the heels of a viral video showing a burmese python wrestling and killing an alligator, the director of the South Florida Water Management District launched a program to hunt snakes throughout his district. , Subscribe to VICE News here: , http://bit.ly/Subscribe-to-VICE-News, Check out VICE News for more: , http://vicenews.com, Follow VICE News here:, Facebook: , https://www.facebook.com/vicenews, Twitter: , https://twitter.com/vicenews, Tumblr: , http://vicenews.tumblr.com/, Instagram: , http://instagram.com/vicenews, More videos from the VICE network: , https://www.fb.com/vicevideo","

Static methods do not take the instance or the class as the first argument. They behave just like normal functions, yet they should have some logical connection to our class. We will look at some examples of both of these in order to understand both in depth.

    Python Regurgitates Pet Dog In Front Of Owner
  ",,Viral Press,,"522,392 views",68,22,"Published on Oct 11, 2019","A heartbroken pensioner looked on as a wild python regurgitated her beloved pet dog. Neam Boonkerd, 70, had been concerned after all of her chickens and pet cat disappeared in recent months from her home in Prachuab Khiri Khan, southern Thailand. The elderly woman was worried when she went looking for her pet dog, named Toob, on Tuesday (08/10) morning but he was nowhere to be seen. Neam then found the 16ft long python strangling her pet dog which was yelping desperately for help. The frail grandma, unable to grapple with the snake herself, called the rescue team hoping that they could save her pooch. But by the time the rescuers came, the greedy python had already swallowed the pooch and was coiled up by a tree. Rescuers captured the reptile and it regurgitated the pooch, which emerged covered in slime in front of the heartbroken old lady., ------------------------------------------------------------------, Thank you for watching this video on ViralPress!

If you are one among the curious to learn python programming language, you are at the right place. This is one of the best online python tutorials for the beginners and we hope this python tutorial will give you the best path to learn python programming language in the easiest way!, Check out the topics covered in this Python tutorial session:, ‚Ä¢ What is Python?, ‚Ä¢ Why should we use Python for Data Science?, ‚Ä¢ Data types in Python, - Simple types, - Complex types, ‚Ä¢ Lists, Sets, tuples, Integers, ‚Ä¢ Input Methods, ‚Ä¢ Loops, - While loop, - For loop, ‚Ä¢ Conditions, - If, else, - If elif, else , Python is a programming language; the programming languages will make computers to operate the functions the way we require. Whether it is an addition or handling a large amount of user‚Äôs request in the website background or backend. There is always a programming language which will help us to customize the way the computer works., There are many categories of programming languages, in that we can categorize them into 3 levels i.e. Machine level language, Assembly language, and High-level language. So, these are the three-distinct classification of the programming languages., Machine Level languages are quite binary in nature, they are quite difficult to code. , Assembly Level languages will use symbols, mnemonics, and they are quite easier to code compared to the machine level., High-level languages are the easiest among all to code because they use English keywords. It is very easy to read, learn, and write as well. Here are some of the high-level programming languages, C, C++, Java, C#, Haskell, Python, Scala etc., In high-level programming languages, there are two further classifications, - Object-oriented programming languages, - Functional programming languages, So as a conclusion we can define python as, it is a high-level programming language, which is functional in nature and also supports the concepts of object-oriented programming., Versions of Python: Python has got two important versions, , - Python version 2, - Python version 3, Go through the entire video and shoot your queries in the comments section and please do not forget to subscribe the channel for more tutorials and technology updates., #python, , , #pythonlectures, , , #pythonlanguage, , , #pythonfunctions, , , #pythonfordatascience, , , #pythoncodingforbeginners, , , #pythoncoding, , , #pythonlanguage, For more updates on courses and tips follow us on:, Facebook: , https://www.facebook.com/acadgild, Twitter: , https://twitter.com/acadgild, LinkedIn: , https://www.linkedin.com/company/acad...","

    Exceptions in Python || Python Tutorial || Learn Python Programming
  ",,Socratica,,"92,380 views","3,323",48,"Published on Jun 2, 2018","Exceptions allow you to write code which may not work, and then handle the successful and failed cases separately.  The four clauses in Python Exception handling are try, except, else, and finally.  These give you the ability to handle an error (except), a success (else), or either (finally).

Top predators like the american crocodiles and american alligators prey regularly on all kinds of reptiles, including pythons. An adult alligator will have little trouble to overpower, kill and eat any juvenile and in some cases even an adult constrictor. Nevertheless, a fully grown Burmese Python can reach over twenty feet in lengths and becomes extremely dangerous prey item for most crocodilians including the American Alligator. These large constrictors have not much to fear and will feed on most animals they come across (including alligators) when hungry. Python vs Alligator was filmed by Heiko Kiera aka Ojatro near the Everglades in 2009.","
